     <br> There is no support for IBM Watson yet. However, a group of community members is working on a way to use <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/learn-how-to-export-import-a-watson-assistant-workspace/" target="_blank">exported IBM Watson workspaces</a> in Rasa. If you're interested in that, check out our <a class="reference external" href="https://forum.rasa.com/" target="_blank">Community Forum</a>. a

At Rasa, we hear a few different reasons why developers switch from cloud-based tools like IBM Watson: a

* **Faster**: Runs locally - no https requests and server round trips required a
* **Customizable**: Tune models and get higher accuracy with your data set a
* **Open source**: No risk of vendor lock-in - Rasa comes with an Apache 2.0 licence and you can use it in commercial projects a
